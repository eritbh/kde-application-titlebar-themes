# Obsidian

Obsidian 1.0 has an option to use the native titlebar, under Settings > Appearance > Advanced > Window frame style: "Native frame".

Earlier versions of Obsidian did not have an option for this; CSS tweaks or plugins were required to hide the standard titlebar, and KDE window rules could be used to force the native one to be used in its place.
